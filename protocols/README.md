## Precautions

All protocol implementations in this directory are intended for basic demonstration and adaptation to ckb protocols, there is no guarantee that they will not break.

Each protocol is closely related to the upper-layer application. When an application decides to break or upgrade a protocol, the version of the protocol needs to be updated by the maintainer of the application, resulting in a strong correlation that minimizes the value of the public domain protocol.

So if you need to use it for a production project, it is recommended to fork directly.
